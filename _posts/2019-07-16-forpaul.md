	Oh, what a life we shared together
	Some times were hard, others much better
	We made a promise and kept it through Christ
	To bring him glory with our love and life

	For better or for worse
	In sickness and in health
	For richer or poorer
	Our love has been great wealth
	I stood before you
	And promised you my heart
	I held your hand and you held mine
	til death do us part

	Oh, how we laughed and sang together.
	You kept me smiling thru whatever.
	My days were better for all you have been.
	My leader, my protector, husband, friend.

	For better or for worse
	In sickness and in health
	For richer or poorer
	Our love has been great wealth
	For thirty-five years
	You softened up my heart
	I never willed to let you go
	til death do us part

	Oh, how I love you and gave you my all
	I ne'er imagined I would see death's call
	we spent our days as the Lord did lend
	And now time echoes the phrase at the end.

	For better or for worse
	In sickness and in health
	For richer or poorer
	Our love has been great wealth
	I now let you go
	Now with my aching heart
	Holding to your memory
	til death do us part.
