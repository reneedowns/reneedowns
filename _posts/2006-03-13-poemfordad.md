	I'm leaving my wheelchair behind
	No more confinement for me
	With a brand new body, a gift from God
	The blood of Jesus has set me free

	I'm leaving my glasses behind
	No more blurry vision for me
	I once saw dimly as through a mirror
	But now the face of my Savior I see

	I'm leaving my sins all behind
	They've been paid for by His grace
	Though I don't deserve it, I believe
	And the crucified Christ has taken my place

	I'm leaving my troubles behind
	I'm in a place without worries or fears
	My Lord Jesus has prepared me a home
	And He has wiped away all of my tears

	I'm leaving my loved ones behind
	And hoping they'll join me someday
	Accepting the gift of salvation
	Through Jesus Christ, the only way.

	"No eye has seen,
	no ear has heard,
	no mind has conceived
	what God has prepared
	for those who love him."

 **1 Corinthians 2:9**
