Are you looking for more?
Are you feeling empty, afraid, dissatisfied with life?
Are you longing for true love, peace, a real purpose?

If so, we can assure you that God has great plans for you.
He made you and delights in showing you His mercy.

No matter your current situation,
no matter the choices you made that brought you where you are,
He wants you to understand His unconditional love for you.

Isaiah says in the Bible,

>    "Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you;
>    He rises to show you compassion." 

God sent His son Jesus into the world

>    "not to condemn the world,
>    but to save the world through Him" 

God made a way through Jesus' death on the cross for us to become His children.
It's not about what we've done, but accepting His sacrifice for our failure.

Over 30 years ago, I received God's payment for my salvation.
By grace, I was saved through faith,
and my soul has been filled with overwhelming joy.
So I must tell whoever I can about this amazing free gift.

Jesus Christ can change your life.

Let us know if we can help.
